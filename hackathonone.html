  <center> <h1> About Us:</h1> </center>
  <p>   <p> <center> Hannie Brown has always been dedicated to helping animals! Four years ago,  Hannie went on a mission trip to New Zealand and discovered that there are many neglected hedgehogs in the north. Hannie decided she would rescue these helpless animals and bring them back to her hometown, in Michigan. Ever since she rescued her first five hedgehogs she decided that she would breed them and sell them to familes across the country! Hannie has been selling these adorable pets ever since!Stay tuned for more hedgehogs available in the future
